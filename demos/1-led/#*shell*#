## Description

This program confirms that at least one periodic interrupt occurs.

It (1) sets up P1 to control the LEDS, (2) enables periodic
interrupts, and then (3) the the periodic interrrupt (repeatedly turns
on the red LED.

## Suggested Activities

* Modify so that different combinations of LEDs are illuminated.

* Try to modify the interrupt handler so that an LED flashes on and off
  quickly (and thereby appears dimmer).DON'T MODIFY THE MAIN.
